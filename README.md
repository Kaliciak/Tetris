#  How to run project
Before compiling project, make sure that you have properly set environmental variable `$PATH_TO _FX`.
You can set it by command:\
 `export PATH_TO_FX=path/to/javafxlib`\
 If you don't have installed javafx you can download it from site:\
  https://gluonhq.com/products/javafx/ \
  When your environmental variable is set, you can compile project with `build.sh` and then run it with `run.sh`.
